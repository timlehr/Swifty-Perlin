# Swifty-Perlin
Classic Perlin Noise generator (Swift w/ example)

This code was an excerise to wrap my head around the math behind popular noise algorithms. 
The classic Perlin noise generator should be working fine. Simplex is still a work in progress.
The playgrounds are just for tinkering. Check out the Xcode project for a working example written in Swift 2.
